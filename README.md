# 🚀 Performance Test Result Narrator

## 1. Project Overview

Performance Test Result Narrator is an AI-powered application that transforms raw performance testing results into business-friendly insights. The system analyzes uploaded performance reports, computes key latency and reliability metrics, evaluates SLA health, performs optional time-series analysis, and generates executive-level summaries using a Large Language Model (LLM).

The application helps performance engineers, QA teams, project managers, and stakeholders quickly understand application health without manually interpreting complex performance metrics.

### End-to-End Workflow

Input Report → Analysis Engine → SLA Evaluation → AI Narration → HTML Executive Report → Dashboard Output

## 2. Problem Statement

Performance testing tools such as k6 and JMeter generate large amounts of technical performance data.

Typical reports contain metrics such as:

* Average Response Time
* P50 Latency
* P95 Latency
* P99 Latency
* Error Rate

While these metrics are useful for performance engineers, non-technical stakeholders often struggle to answer questions such as:

* Is the application healthy?
* Are response times acceptable?
* Is the SLA being met?
* What business risk exists?
* What corrective actions should be taken?

Manual interpretation takes time and often depends on experienced performance engineers.

This project automates that process using AI-powered narration.
